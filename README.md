The Black-Scholes model is also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton or BSM model.
It's a differential equation that's widely used to price options contracts.
The Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.
The Black-Scholes model is usually accurate but it makes certain assumptions that can lead to predictions that deviate from real-world results.
The standard BSM model is only used to price European options because it doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date.
